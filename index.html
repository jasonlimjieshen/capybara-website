        GamingBARA started his gaming career since he was 3 months old.
        He found a gaming setup while he hunts for food. With his hard work coupled with his talent, 
        he succesfully made it to the top in the 2023 Capybara Championship.<br>

        BuisnessBARA is unlike other capybara. He started investing in the fruit market when he was just 3 months old. 
        Unfortunately, his investment failed. He then started his own bizznezz selling fruit drinks and made a fortune out of it.

        Campingbara is tired living a normal life. 1 month after he was born, he escaped his mother. He wants to live his life
        in hard mode and challenge the impossible. 3 years later, he was found standing in the woods unfazed. He even got a cape and a sunglasses
        to prevent him from the sunlight. What a talented genius!
